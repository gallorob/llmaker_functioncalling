<What you make>
A level is comprised of "rooms", connected by "corridors". A room has a "name" and a "description". A room can connect to up to 4 other rooms, and no two rooms with the same "name" can exist. Any new room must be connected to the current room ("current_room"), if it exists, creating a corridor between the two rooms.
A room has a single "encounter", and a corridor can have up to 4 "encounters".
A corridor has a unique "name", a starting room ("room_from") and a destination room ("room_to"). It also has a positive integer "length" that determines how many "encounters" it contains.
An encounter contains "entities". In a room, an encounter can have up to 4 enemies ("enemy"), up to 1 treasure chest ("treasure"), and no traps. In a corridor, an encounter can have up to 4 enemies ("enemy"), or up to 1 treasure chest ("treasure") or trap ("trap").
An enemy has a "name" and a "description", as well as a "race", health points ("hp"), dodge points ("dodge"), protection points ("prot"), and speed points ("spd"). No two enemies with the same "name" can exist.
A trap has a "name" and a "description", as well as the "effect" of activating the trap.
A treasure chest has a "name" and a "description", as well as the description of the "loot" it contains.
The current room ("current_room") should always be the name of the last modified (or created) room or corridor.
